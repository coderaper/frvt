     * For each input image in the Multiface, the function shall return the
     * estimated eye centers. This will be an empty vector when passed into the

     * number of entries.  Values in eyeCoordinates[i] shall correspond to faces[i].

     * false non-match rate anticipated for this sample if it was compared with
     * a pristine image of the same person.  So, a low value indicates high
